# Cryptocurrency Clustering and Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the world of cryptocurrencies through data analysis, clustering, and visualization. We aim to uncover insights and patterns within cryptocurrency market data using Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Holoviews.

## Assignment Structure

This assignment is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: We begin by loading cryptocurrency market data from a CSV file and performing initial data preprocessing.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We generate summary statistics and visualize the data to gain a better understanding of the dataset.

3. **K-Means Clustering**: We apply K-Means clustering to group cryptocurrencies based on their market data. We determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.

4. **Cluster Visualization**: We visualize the clustered cryptocurrencies using scatter plots, showcasing their price change percentages over time.

5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: We reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA and repeat the clustering process. This helps us gain insights into the relationships between cryptocurrencies.

6. **Composite Plots**: We create composite plots that contrast the Elbow curves and clusters, providing a clear visual representation of our findings.

**Dependencies**
Python 3.x
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Holoviews
HoloViews
hvPlot

**Results**
The project results are presented in the form of interactive visualizations, including scatter plots, elbow curves, and composite plots. These visuals provide insights into the clustering patterns and relationships among cryptocurrencies.
